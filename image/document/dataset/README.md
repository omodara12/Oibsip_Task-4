## PREDICTING HOUSE PRICES WITH LINEAR REGRESSION
### Introduction
##### In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate housing prices using linear regression. The dataset includes various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The primary goal was to apply the fundamental machine learning workflowâ€”starting with data exploration and cleaning, proceeding through model training and evaluation, and finally offering actionable insights through meaningful visualizations.
##### Learning Objectives:
##### .Understanding of linear regression concepts
##### .Practical experience in implementing a predictive model
##### .Model evaluation and interpretation skill
